## Getting up and running

## Windows
- Install git and clone the repository.
- If you'd prefer not to use Git, you can get the source with the 'Download ZIP' button on the right.
- Install Visual Studio. The project was created and tested with tools of version 2019 (but I use the Rider for UE4 IDE).
- Load the project into Visual Studio by double-clicking on the .sln file.
- Compile and run using debug/run buttons.
